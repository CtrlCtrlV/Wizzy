## About
Apache Wizard or “Wizzy” is a personal assistant designed and built by Apache Blackout Studio and RXQuisite. Of its many iterations and variations, the best one, Wiz X, is designed to be run on the Discord platform. It is powered by Apache Blackout Studio’s software-WizKit (Wiz personal assistant templates), WizOS (Wiz personal assistant architecture), Keybine (command handling x for Wiz), and DeepSense (high-level intelligence and NLP for command processing).

Wizzy can be interacted with via text through the Discord platform, but also has a Siri Plugin to enable voice-based commands for iOS.
